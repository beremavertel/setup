# setup

Add setup/scripts to your $PATH, or navigate to setup/scripts and:

Run find_modules.py

If you want to only run on installed modules, create a text file named "modules" in the same folder that you're running the script in, containing the names of the installed modules (This can be achieved by running `odoomodules $DATABASENAME > modules`)
